# Introduction

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. (Wikipedia) While, Docker Hub is the world's easiest way to create, manage, and deliver your teams' container applications. This project would show how to encapsulate a python scripty into a docker container and push the image to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) so that it can be access by anyone who interested on it. 

# Python App

The python app is named Charater Image. It can convert a jpg file to charater image.
